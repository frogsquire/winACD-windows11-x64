	* ACDExt.vcproj: Added a new file item ".\acdext.dll.manifest" for
	xp themes support. See comment for the new file. Added
	ISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED preprocessor definition.
	* ACDHidDev.cpp ACDHidDev.h: Constness changes. Added a new accessor
	for the hid device handle.
	* ACDShlExt.cpp: Close the unused handles we create when scanning the
	system hid devices. Make sure we also close the ACD hid handles when the
	psp goes away.
	* resource.h ACDExt.rc: Increased revision. Some PSP Dialog properties
	changes and added a new resource entry for the dll.manifest.
	* ReadMe: Generated by VS.
	* acdext.dll.manifest: New file. This manifest is used by the system
	to load comctl32 v6.0 instead of the default v5.8. 6.0 contains the new
	themed controls and is required if we want to have the same look and
	feel as the other PSP in the device panel.
